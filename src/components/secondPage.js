        <pre className='paragraf'>The design of your next stone or tile project is already well underway. Itâ€™s a process that<br/> 
             began millions of years ago, miles beneath the surface of the earth. We take over where <br/> 
             nature leaves off, importing the finest natural stone and porcelain tile from around the <br/> 
             globe and continuing its millennia-long process of formation. Like the origins of the <br/> 
             products we offer, our passion for architecture and design runs deep.</pre>
